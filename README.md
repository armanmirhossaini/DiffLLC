#  Using this as my business website for Diff LLC
A business website using node.js. Hosted on github pages. 

This repo is to be used to host and modify COLaB business website for a static webpage that displays current information on the development/stages of the application. 

Here are the notes needed for using the code I sent you:

Replace Diff with COLaB, underneath have Founders - Arman, Chris

For the Welcome to Our Site Spot - remove the picture of me and this is where we describe we are creating COLaB - a decentrailized online virtual platform to enhance peer-to-peer collaboration amongst college students. (I will add better text later - you can just add in some bs filler) The text on the right of my picture should simply be the expansion of the acronym: COLaB - Collegiate Online Learning and Brainstorming, the left is where the app description should be.

Change Services to be 'Product' and that is where i put the demo of app from design so have it empty

Remove My Skills to 'Founders' and there should be 3 divs with circular pictures like mine in the welcome to our site and under it a personal description of ourselves.

Leave the Purpose Statement for now, ill add something

For the follow us, find a linkedin icon, and we put our linkedins on it and remove the other three buttons

for contact us, just put your email and number under mine for now.

So you need to push all this to git, so you can clone down this repo, put the code in then push it in, so we have it here, then when you add small changes incrementally commit it and push it if it completely works, then we will run it on heroku using my logins. So ill do that. OR: it be better we host using github.io its easier and more accessible: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages

Before you push anything call me or questions
